    <h2> Description</h3>
    <p>In this classic lasagna recipe, layers of savory goodness come together to create a comforting and flavorful dish. The heart of the recipe lies in a robust meat sauce crafted from ground beef, onions, and garlic, simmered to perfection with crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. The addition of red wine, though optional, introduces a subtle richness.</p>
    <p>Assembling the lasagna involves the careful layering of cooked noodles with a luscious cheese mixture. The cheese filling, a velvety combination of ricotta, egg, fresh parsley, salt, and pepper, adds a creamy and indulgent texture to each bite. This layers-on-layers approach continues, with each tier featuring a symphony of flavors – the meaty tomato sauce, the richness of mozzarella, and the sharpness of Parmesan.</p>
    <p>Once assembled, the lasagna enters the oven to undergo a delightful transformation. Covered initially to ensure even cooking, it emerges bubbling and golden after a stint in the heat. The aroma wafting from the oven is a promise of the delectable amalgamation of ingredients within.</p>
    <p>Allowing the lasagna to cool slightly before serving ensures that each slice retains its form, revealing the strata of flavors beneath. Whether enjoyed on its own or paired with garlic bread or a fresh green salad, this homemade lasagna is a testament to the joy of classic, comforting Italian cuisine.</p>
